![Screenshot of the editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alzter/TuxBuilder/master/EditorScreenshot.png)

A re-implementation of the jump'n'run game SuperTux, coded from the ground up in Godot.
Some of SuperTux's art, sound and music assets are used or modified here.

To play this game you will need Godot 3.2 and the source code. Once you have those unzip
the source code and open src/project.godot with Godot.

To learn how to use Godot you can read the official documentation [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/).
If you prefer learning with videos you can find a list of Godot youtubers [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/community/tutorials.html).
